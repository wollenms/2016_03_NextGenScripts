# 2016_03_NextGenScripts
A collection of Perl scripts for processing Illumina NextGen data, as well as a description of the pipeline of analysis with macqiime and Perl script commands.

Scripts included in this repository, in the order they are used, are the following:

0) 00_grabotus.pl

1) 01_matchotus.pl

2) 02_remoteblast.pl

NOTE - you will have to edit/modify at the very least scripts 00 & 01 to use them ... you may also need to install bioperl and modify 02 and 03 depending on your particular needs.
